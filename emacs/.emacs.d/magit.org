** Magit Version Control.

Git is the most popular version control platform for software
development. It is widely supported on all computer platforms, and is
supported by a range of graphical clients as well as straightforward
command-line based usage. Many of the text editors favoured by
developers have some sort of built-in Git support.

And then there is Emacs and Magit. Magit is a piece of software so
good that I subscribe to help to fund the on-going development! Simply
put, Magit is a Git client built in to Emacs, but it is absolutely
brilliant at what it does.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable Magit and configure the 'Git Status' keyboard shortcut C-x g
  (use-package magit
    :config (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status))
#+end_src
