** Aesthetics - The Look and Feel.

Having configured Magit and Helm, Emacs has now got the bare minimum
that I would like to have in place to make the software work. But of
course, there are lots of things that will need to be done to make it
as good as I know it can be.

For now the configuration is addressing just the look and feel of
Emacs. It isn't particularly ugly, but it is staid in its appearance,
and there is screen furniture that I would like to get rid of because
it is stuff that I don't really need or want.

*** Minimise the Screen Furniture in the Emacs Window.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Switch off unnecessary screen furniture.
  (menu-bar-mode 0)
#+end_src
