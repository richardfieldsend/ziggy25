# Conky Configuration.

One of the reasons for using a desktop manager like i3wm is that the
windowing system is relatively low impact in terms of the resources
used. However, that doesn't mean you have to survive with no eye-candy
at all!

Conky is used to embed content in the desktop, and it fits well with
the i3wm which, unlike desktop managers like Gnome, KDE or (shudder)
Windows, doesn't show the contents of the 'Desktop' folder on the
desktop. The lack of file icons means that you can have a pristine
canvas to present information on.

Add in the use of the compton compositor so that you can make the
output of conky transparent so its not hiding the regularly updated
wallpaper.

This file will be updated to highlight the way the file is modified
from the default version that ships with Linux Mint.
